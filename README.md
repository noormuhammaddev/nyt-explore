## Features

1. NYT Most popular articles List

## General Information
I have used some 3rd party libraries/npm packages to make my code more efficient like 
1. `Material UI` to mantain the UI side of the application
2. `Unit Test` to achieve high code coverage with Jest and React Testing Library for the used components, I had needed to write unit tests that cover various aspects of the component's behavior

## Ignore Stuff
1. Since there isn't a picture in the data that was pulled from the API, I had to use the online dummy image instead of the one that was in the card to demonstrate how to display the actual article image.
